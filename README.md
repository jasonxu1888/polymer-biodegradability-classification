# A transfer-learned ML tool for classifying biodegradability of large polymers through a GCN
### Chemical pollution has been acknowledged as a crisis by most world powers. Under OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) guidelines, experimental biodegradability testing of chemicals is required to label products as RB (readily-biodegradable) and NRB (nonreadily-biodgradeable) before commercial or industrial use is allowed. In silico categorization of chemicals or compounds as RB or NRB can be done from the avenue of machine learning. To accomplish in silico categorization of small chemicals and compounds, a binary GCN classification model was recreated from Lee and Min’s paper, ’A Comparative Study of the Performance for Predicting Biodegradability Classification: The Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship Model vs the Graph Convolutional Network (2022).’ A transfer learning approach was then applied to expand this model to the target domain of classifying biodegradability of large polymers.
